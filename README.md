Development 
1. Clear API Design:
Define and document RESTful APIs for each functionality (products, cart, users, orders) with proper endpoints, HTTP methods, and payload structures.

2. Layered Architecture:
Maintain a clear separation between Controllers (handling API requests), Services (business logic), and Repositories (database interactions) for scalability and modularity.

3. Validation and Error Handling:
Implement input validations for API requests and provide meaningful error messages. Use custom exceptions for clear debugging.

4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
Ensure secure role-based access using JWT, with separate roles for users (e.g., product browsing) and admins (e.g., inventory management).

5. Concurrency Management:
Handle critical operations like inventory updates during high-traffic scenarios using synchronization or database-level locking to prevent stock inconsistencies.
Testing:

Unit Testing:

1. Integration Testing:
Test API endpoints end-to-end with mock data to ensure proper integration between layers.

2. Postman API Testing:
Use Postman to test API endpoints for all scenarios, including valid requests, edge cases, and invalid inputs.

3. Security Testing:
Validate JWT token creation, expiration, and role-based access to ensure only authorized actions are allowed.
